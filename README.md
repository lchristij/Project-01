# Event Driven Robo Advisor Project:
Our project will produce a robo advisor for Individual Investors to predict the impacts of News/Fed/Gov Announcements across several asset classes. We will analyze the impact of various Economic Shocks from 2000 to present. Specifically, we are going to measure the impact of the Federal Reserve and U.S. Government actions on various ETFs (through the Alpaca and/or Alpha Vantage APIs) representing different asset classes which include, but are not limited to Equities, Bonds, Commodities and Crypto. In addition, we will map the impact of both Monetary and Fiscal actions by the Federal Reserve (lowered/raised rates & Asset purchasing) and the U.S. Government (stimulus checks, tax cuts, etc.) during the period and provide predictions for each ETF through Monte Carlo for a "crystal ball" on the continued intervention and impacts on Asset Classes beyond 2020.
